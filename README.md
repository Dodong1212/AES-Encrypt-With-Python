# AES-Encrypt-With-Python
The encryption code encrypts a specific folder and the extension can be randomly set by the user.  
The code can be applied in a variety of ways, such as a function that allows only specific users to be demodified, by comparing the password used for decoding.

The AES_Decrypt_Python_one.py file can be selected directly by right clicking on the file that you want to be a GUI.
After making the python code into an executable file, it can be used by changing the register value.

To make the PYTHON code into a executable file, you can use the pyinstaller.
